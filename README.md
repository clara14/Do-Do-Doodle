# Do-Do-Doodle

Online multiplayer in-browser drawing game. Players compete with each other by trying to be the first to correctly guess the object being drawn.

At the beginning of each round, one of the players is randomly selected to be the designated 'drawer' and also given the name of an object to draw. They are tasked with drawing said object while the other players try to correctly guess what is being drawn using the chat function outside of the drawing board. A correct answer will award both the answerer and the drawer points. Players will alternate roles until everyone has had a chance to draw.
